The ideal fit will be an engineer who loves to learn and take on new challenges, and can solve a variety of problems to ensure the success of the overall service, in partnership with our product and customer-facing teams.\n\n\nIf you are growth-oriented, passionate about technology, and excited about building exceptional UIs and complex business services, we want to hear from you!\n\n\nWhat you’ll be doing:\n\n\n● Working on our Typelevel Scala backend services and our React single-page application.\n● Embracing AI coding assistants to delegate the boring, repetitive tasks while focusing on the creative, important work. We believe in AI as an enabler of velocity improvements, while being cognizant of the constraints; and deploy its strengths intentionally.\n● Building robust QA, unit and integration tests.\n● Writing top documentation about the features you help deliver.\n● Taking turns to investigate our customers’ escalated tickets and respond (we don’t do on-call rotations, not yet at least).\n● Collaborating in Scrum ceremonies and engage with cross-functional teams for requirements.\n● Managing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and reliability.\n● Monitoring system health with observability tools and address issues proactively.\n● Engaging with stakeholders for alignment on project goals and updates.\n● Researching new technologies to improve the Snowplow ecosystem.\n\n\nWe’d love to hear from you if:\n\n\n● You have professional experience building 1) RESTful APIs with Typelevel Scala, and 2) engaging user experiences for the Web with Typescript and React.\n● You understand API and browser performance, as well as web accessibility standards. \n● You have an array of tools under your belt to support making a web application faster and more accessible.\n● You place maximum emphasis on security. Data security and integrity are fundamental to what we do, so you’ll need a solid understanding of security threats and how to overcome them.\n● Nice to have, not necessary: Golang and Python experience would come very handy, for a few repositories outside of the critical path.\n\n\nWhat We Offer You in Return:\n\n\n💰 A competitive package, including share options\n🧘 Flexible working\n🏖 A generous holiday allowance no matter where you are in the world\n💻 MacBook and home office equipment allowance\n👪 Enhanced maternity, paternity, shared parental and adoption leave\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnowplow is dedicated to building and supporting a brilliant, diverse and hugely inclusive team.

We’re the software team behind innovative products like The Light Phone & Mill, and we a global, decentralized community space collective called Index Space.
We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We work on projects that bring value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a genuine curiosity about life outside of our jobs.
🔮
Who we’re looking for:
Right now, we’re looking for a
Senior Elixir Engineer
 with expertise in web, backend and/or native app development, and interest in systems architecture and IoT.
In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. You would work on
full-stack apps
 across many industries, from e-commerce to connected hardware products. Responsibilities will include:
Crafting technical architecture plans through interfacing with clients to understand product requirements
Developing and optimizing technical solutions while keeping in mind performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness
Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed
The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top level / strategic conversations.
We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design & quality — so a variety of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!
💸 Compensation
Our pay scale ranges from
$85 p/hr
 to
$130 p/hr
 pending seniority (& team leadership experience), and our projects are rarely less than 8 full time weeks at 40 hours per week. Additionally, we pay discretionary bonuses for going over and above — like training & coaching others, winning new business, speaking at conferences, etc.
We prefer long standing relationships with highly accountable and communicative team members, so we encourage candidates to expect longer term engagements. A senior engineer working 40 — 45 full time weeks may take home
$150k — $225k USD.
🔑
Must Have Competencies:
Fluency in Elixir, and production experience maintaining Elixir Phoenix apps
8+ years general experience in backend (Ruby on Rails, Elixir Phoenix, Python Django, or Node Express) and/or native app development (React Native, Flutter, Android, AOSP, Kotlin/Java).
Comfort with building performant and polished frontend applications (React, CSS, Accessibility, etc)
Extensive experience with API Design and knowledge of REST and GraphQL, as well as authentication strategies with JWTs and OAuth 2.0.
Fluency in SQL & database operations, and extensive experience with one of PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL or SQLite.
Fluency in HTTP, Caching, Status Codes, Security Standards and other Web protocols & patterns.
Experience with AWS, GCP, or Azure and a core understanding of best practices such as IAM & credential management.
Production experience with PaaS providers such as Heroku, Render, Cloud66, Vercel, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, Docker, or Gigalixir.
💪
Nice to Have Competencies:
We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the areas below are relevant to us!
Fluency in Elixir LiveView or experience with Rails Hotwire
Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and other generalist AI-enabled application patterns
Product management experience, including defining product roadmaps and working closely with stakeholders.
Hands-on experience with Zenhub, Trello, Jira or similar.
Client-facing experience, working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions.
Engineering management experience, including leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers.
Experience in Hardware, Firmware, or Internet of Things (IoT).
Native IDEs (Xcode, Android Studio), Languages & Low Level experience (Swift, Rust, C & C++, Clang & LLVM), Electron, V8 & NAN.
🎤
How we interview:
Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.
→ It’s also a great way to see what it’s like to work with us and help support folks who may not have the ‘right title’ but have the experience and technical know-how for the role.
👩‍🏭
How we work:
We believe that there’s a better balance between the poles of freelancing & full time, and for that reason Sanctuary works differently to most shops:
Transparency & Ownership:
 We release out Profit & Loss statements to the community each year, open source our best ideas, and talk business & money with everyone in the company. We’re proud to run our business with integrity, and for that reason we share everything with our team & community.
**150% Carbon Negative:
** Our studio offsets 150% of the carbon we use to do business each year, dated back to our founding in 2015. We turn down work that is not in-line with our morals, and we encourage our peers to do the same.
We were certified climate neutral earlier this year
.
**Strong Morals:
** Since our founding, we've turned down somewhere between $1mm - $2mm of work that didn't meet our moral standards. (Most of that was DTC brands that can't show a valid sustainability initiative).
Async & Decentralized:
 We use tools optimized for calm, thoughtful communication, and opt for async whenever possible. We fight hard to maintain our focus time.
Remote Friendly:
 Our company is fluent in remote work, making our workplace more decentralized, and democratized in the process.
Ideas & Products:
 In our spare studio time, we work to build our own open source or internal products to diversify & bolster our income. We create amazing technology products for our clients, so why not for the studio?
